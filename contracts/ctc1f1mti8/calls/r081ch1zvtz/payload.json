It would be good to nominate a donation address for the winning to go to, not the participants. eg 4 people in the lottery and winnings go to a set address, with special mention for the 'donor winner\" for the deposit.\n\nor ... winnings a split between the winner and the donation address. 50% each. 5 people each put in 10 and winner gets 25 and donation address gets 25."}
