Europe is a communist paradise with gangs of muslim criminals, other places are too odd. The US could be good, but it seems their government is very efficient.\n\nMaybe Uruguay, as it is near and similar but has 1000x less crime than here. Or Chile, as it has better environment for business.",

They could because in late XIX some reforms happened thanks to Alexander II the Liberator who liquidated serfdom law. Also in the early XX century prime-minister Stolypin initiated government program for re-settlement of the enormous amount of people and essentially gifted land in private property. These peasants actually could have land only for short period of time until bolsheviks came in power and introduced their own laws...",
