This contract allows any project owner to create a page users can request new features from.

With each request users must attach some satoshis. To upvote requests, users also attach satoshis (each counts as one vote).

Project owners are free to `cancel` features and keep the money, it's not as if users were hiring the project owner. When a feature is implemented it is marked as `finished`.

When creating a project page owners must supply a `name` a `logo` URL, a project `URL` and a `key`. Each project page will be automatically hosted on `https://features.etleneum.com/#/{key}`.
