{"desc": "Paul Sztorc has written multiple enormous articles about Drivechain, but it's all too arcane for the average user, thus Drivechain remains unknown to anyone.\n\nThere's a video I don't remember where anymore, but it has Paul talking to the camera, explaining the mechanism behind the hashrate-escrow-based 2-way peg step-by-step with a PowerPoint presentation. That video is great, but no one ever finds it, and before getting to the explanation people must watch dozens of minutes of Paul trashing his critics that don't understand Drivechain at all and assume never having read any of the Drivechain explanations.\n\nThe fact that not even these high-profile critics have read anything or understood the mechanism behind Drivechain 2-way peg is evidence of the necessity of a simpler write-up explanaing it. Clear, small, direct to the point.", "head": "Create a Drivechain explanation that more people can understand"}
