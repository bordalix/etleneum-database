{"key": "lntxbot", "name": "Custom commands developer API", "description": "Allow other apps to integrate custom commands without having to merge code into lntxbot's codebase, perhaps under `/custom_something` or `/app_something`.\n\nThere could be a `/register_app` that would take an URL with details of how the command would work, then the bot would know what options to present to the user when they are called then do something based on some URL calls.\n\nAuthentication from each lntxbot user to the external app could be done using the lnurl-auth features that already exist and invoice paying/withdrawing could be automatic too with lnurl somehow."}
